    "# **Lab: Conflict Resolution (In Git...)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will work with a partner to simulate and resolve merge conflicts using Git and GitHub. By the end of this lab, you should understand how to handle merge conflicts and collaborate effectively on code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Create a Shared Repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student A will create a new repository on GitHub.\n",
    "   - Include a README file.\n",
    "   - Name the repository and click **Create Repository**.\n",
    "   - Share the repository link with your partner (Student B).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Student B should fork the repository to their own GitHub account.\n",
    "   - Go to the shared repository link provided by Student A.\n",
    "   - Click on the **Fork** button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both students should clone their respective repositories to their local machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone <<repo url here>>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to the repository directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd <<repo name>>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Create a Branch and Make Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Student A**: Create a new branch and make changes.\n",
    "   - Create a branch named `feature-a`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout -b feature-a\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open the `main.py` file (or create one if it doesn’t exist) and add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Student A!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Save the file, stage the changes, and commit them:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add main.py\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Student A: Added greet function\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Push the branch to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin feature-a\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Student B**: Create a new branch and make conflicting changes.\n",
    "   - Create a branch named `feature-b`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout -b feature-b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open the `main.py` file and add the following code (modifying the same line Student A did):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Student B!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Save the file, stage the changes, and commit them:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add main.py\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Student B: Added greet function\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Push the branch to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin feature-b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Merge Branches Locally to Simulate a Conflict**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Student A**: Merge the `feature-a` branch into the `main` branch locally.\n",
    "   - Switch to the `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Merge the `feature-a` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git merge feature-a\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Push the changes to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Student B**: Attempt to merge the `feature-b` branch into the `main` branch locally, which should create a conflict.\n",
    "   - First, ensure your `main` branch is up-to-date with the remote:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout main\n",
    "    git pull origin main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Switch to your `feature-b` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout feature-b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Merge the `main` branch into `feature-b`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git merge main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This will likely result in a merge conflict because both branches modified the same lines in `main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Resolve the Merge Conflict**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Student B**: Resolve the merge conflict.\n",
    "   - Open the `main.py` file in a text editor. You will see a conflict marked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Student A!\")\n",
    "    =======\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Student B!\")\n",
    "    >>>>>>> main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Manually resolve the conflict by deciding which changes to keep or by combining both changes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def greet():\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from both Student A and Student B!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Save the file, add the resolved file, and commit the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add main.py\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Push the changes to your branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin feature-b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Student B**: Merge the `feature-b` branch back into the `main` branch locally.\n",
    "   - Switch to the `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Merge the `feature-b` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git merge feature-b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Push the final `main` branch to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Review and Discuss**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both students discuss what they learned about merge conflicts and how they were resolved.\n",
    "- Reflect on how you can avoid conflicts in the future and the importance of clear communication in collaborative projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You’ve successfully simulated and resolved a merge conflict using Git.\n",
    "- This lab has (hopefully) helped you understand the importance of handling conflicts and maintaining a smooth workflow in collaborative projects."

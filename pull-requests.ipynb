    "## **Step 1: Fork the Repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student A will create a repository on GitHub and share the link with the other student (Student B). Use the starter code provided.\n",
    "2. Student B will go to the shared repository link.\n",
    "3. Student B will Fork the repository by clicking the \"Fork\" button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository under their GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository**\n",
    "\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone <<repo url here>>\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd repository\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Create a Branch**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student B will create a new branch to make changes:\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout -b <<branch name here>>\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Student B opens the `main.py` and will complete the functions.\n",
    "2. Save the changes.\n",
    "3. Add the changes to the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add main.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git commit -m \"add your commit message here\"\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Student B pushes their branch to their GitHub repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin <<branch name here>> [//]: # \"Note: adding ... origin <<branch name>> only needs to happen once when pushing a new branch\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student B goes to their forked repository on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Clicks on the \"Compare & pull request\" button to create a PR back to the original repository (owned by Student A).\n",
    "3. Provides a meaningful title and description for the PR.\n",
    "4. Click \"Create pull request.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 7: Accept Pull Request**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Student A will review and accept the pull request, merging the PR on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Student A will the merge the changes to their local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 8: Repeat the Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students A and B will reverse roles and work through the previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 9: Review and Discuss**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both students discuss what they learned about working with Git and GitHub.\n"
